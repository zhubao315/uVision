Read with purpose (20% time on first pass)\n2. Extract patterns (not details)\n3. Build knowledge graph (not notes)\n4. Test with real projects (every 3 days)\n\nToday's experiment: Running SOP-20 on [current book].\n\nWho's reading 100+ books/year? Let's share systems! 📚"

Context window capacity\n2. Tool execution reliability\n3. Feedback loop latency\n\nMistake I made: Over-optimized for #1, ignored #3.\n\nFix: Added circuit breakers + automatic context compression.\n\nNow: Workflows run 4x longer without degradation.\n\nQuestion: What's your workflow's weakest link? 🪐"
