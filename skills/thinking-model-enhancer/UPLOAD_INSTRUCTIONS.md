# Thinking Model Enhancer - Upload Instructions

## Skill Overview

This skill implements an advanced thinking model designed to improve decision-making speed and accuracy. It integrates with memory systems to compare and integrate previous thinking models for continuous enhancement.

## Features

1. **Speed Optimization Techniques**:
   - Parallel processing of multiple approaches
   - Early elimination of unlikely options
   - Pattern recognition for quick categorization
   - Heuristic shortcuts for common scenarios
   - Focused analysis on critical factors

2. **Accuracy Enhancement Methods**:
   - Multi-perspective evaluation
   - Evidence weighting and validation
   - Cross-reference verification
   - Assumption checking protocols
   - Confidence interval assessment

3. **Memory Integration Process**:
   - Retrieve relevant past thinking models from memory
   - Compare current approach with stored models
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses in each approach
   - Integrate successful elements from various models
   - Store refined model for future use

4. **Five-Stage Processing Framework**:
   - Rapid Assessment: Quick preliminary evaluation
   - Detailed Analysis: In-depth examination of options
   - Cross-Validation: Verification against multiple criteria
   - Optimization: Refinement based on goals
   - Integration: Combine with memory-stored models

## Installation Instructions

1. Place the entire `thinking-model-enhancer` directory in your skills directory
2. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
3. Install any required dependencies (none beyond standard library)
4. The skill will automatically integrate with existing memory systems

## Usage Methods

### Basic Execution
```bash
# Run the thinking model processor
python3 scripts/thinking_model_processor.py "Should I invest in this opportunity?"
```

### From Clawdbot
