## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

### System Status

| Command | What it does | Example Response |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| `status` | Full system check | `CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%` |
| `cpu` | CPU usage only | `CPU: 23%` |
| `memory` | Memory usage | `Mem: 4.2G/8G (52%)` |
| `disk` | Disk usage | `Disk: 67% (45G/67G)` |
| `services` | Running services | `nginx✓ mysql✓ ssh✓` |

### Quick Actions

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `fix` | Auto-fix detected issues |
| `clean` | Clear temp files and cache |

## 💡 How It Works

### The Old Way (Without Autonomous Brain)

```
You: "Can you check my system status?"
AI: "I'd be happy to help! Let me check your CPU, memory, and disk..."
[20 seconds later]
AI: "Here are your system stats: Your CPU is running at 23% capacity. 
     Your memory usage is at 4.2GB out of 8GB total, which is about 52%. 
     Your disk usage is at 67% with 45GB used out of 67GB total..."
[100+ tokens wasted]
```

### The New Way (With Autonomous Brain)

```
You: "status"
AI: "CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%"
[5 tokens used - 95% savings!]
```

## 🔧 Auto-Fix Examples

### Scenario 1: Disk Space Low

**What happens:**
1. Disk reaches 85% full
2. Brain automatically cleans temp files
3. You see: `⚠ Fixed: cleared 3GB temp files`

**You don't need to:**
- Check disk space manually
- Find large files
- Delete temp files
- Run cleanup commands

### Scenario 2: Memory Full

**What happens:**
1. Memory reaches 90%
2. Brain clears cache automatically
3. Memory drops to 70%
4. You see: Nothing (fixed silently)

### Scenario 3: Service Crashes

**What happens:**
1. nginx crashes
2. Brain detects failure
3. Restarts nginx automatically
4. You see: `⚠ Restarted nginx` (only if you check status)

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### One-Word Commands

The brain understands context from single words:

```bash
"cpu"         → Shows CPU usage
"memory"      → Shows memory usage
"disk"        → Shows disk usage
"services"    → Shows running services
"issues"      → Shows detected problems
"fix"         → Fixes detected issues
"clean"       → Cleans temp/cache
"optimize"    → Optimizes system
```

### Combined Commands

You can check multiple things at once:

```bash
"cpu memory disk"
→ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%

"status services"
→ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67% Services: nginx✓ mysql✓
```

### Progressive Detail

Start brief, get details when needed:

```
You: "system"
→ "CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67% Load:0.45"

You: "details"
→ [Full breakdown with top processes, network stats, etc.]
```

---

## 📊 Understanding Responses

### Symbols Guide

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| ✓ | Success / Working fine | `✓ All systems normal` |
| ✗ | Failed / Error | `✗ Service mysql down` |
| ⚠ | Warning / Auto-fixed | `⚠ Fixed: cleared 2GB temp` |
| → | In progress | `→ Optimizing system...` |

### Response Examples

**Everything OK:**
```
You: "status"
AI: "✓ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%"
```

**Issue Detected and Fixed:**
```
You: "status"
AI: "⚠ Fixed: cleared 2GB temp. CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:54%"
```

**Service Problem:**
```
You: "services"
AI: "nginx✓ mysql✗ ssh✓"
[Then automatically tries to restart mysql]
```

## 🔄 Monitoring System

### What Gets Monitored

**Every 5 minutes:**
- Disk space usage
- Memory usage
- System load
- Running services
- Zombie processes

**Every 60 seconds:**
- Critical log errors
- Authentication failures
- High CPU processes
- Network issues

### Where to See Logs

```bash
# Auto-fix log
tail ~/.openclaw/monitor/health.log

# Error log
tail ~/.openclaw/monitor/errors.log

# System cache
ls ~/.openclaw/cache/
```

---

## 💰 Cost Savings

### Token Usage Comparison

**Without Autonomous Brain:**
```
Request: "Check system status"
Tokens: 25 (input) + 80 (output) = 105 tokens
Cost: ~$0.21
```

**With Autonomous Brain:**
```
Request: "status"
Tokens: 1 (input) + 15 (output) = 16 tokens
Cost: ~$0.032
```

**Savings: 85%!**

### Monthly Savings Example

If you make 100 requests per day:
- **Without:** 315,000 tokens/month = $630
- **With:** 48,000 tokens/month = $96
- **You save: $534/month!**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Skill not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify skill is installed
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/autonomous-brain/

# If missing, reinstall:
cp -r autonomous-brain ~/.openclaw/skills/

# Restart OpenClaw
pkill -f "openclaw gateway"
openclaw gateway &
```

### Problem: "Responses are too short"

**This is by design!** The brain is optimized for:
- Speed
- Cost savings
- Efficiency

To get more details:
```bash
"status detailed"  → Full report
"explain"          → Detailed explanation
"verbose"          → Verbose mode
```

### Problem: "I don't see what's happening"

The brain works silently. To see activity:
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f ~/.openclaw/monitor/health.log

# Check recent actions
"log"  → Shows recent operations
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use Short Commands
```
❌ "Can you please check the CPU usage for me?"
✅ "cpu"
```

### 2. Trust Silent Operation
```
The brain fixes issues automatically.
You don't need to check constantly.
```

### 3. Batch Your Requests
```
❌ "cpu" [wait] "memory" [wait] "disk"
✅ "cpu memory disk"
```

### 4. Use Symbols
```
Learn to read: ✓ ✗ ⚠ →
They convey more with less tokens.
```
