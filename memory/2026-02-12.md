## Notes
- Network instability affects GitHub operations (TLS/HTTPS both failing)
- Tavily API key is valid and ready for direct integration
- All core OpenClaw skills installed (87/139, 62.6%)
- ClawOps and openclaw-core skills fully functional

## 2026-02-12 09:00 UTC - Memory Recall Issues
- Memory search returning "No API key found for provider openai/google/voyage" errors
- This is a known issue when memory engine requires vector embedding API keys
- Not affecting core functionality (skills, tools, commands work normally)
- Workaround: Use Feishu docs as primary memory store for now
- Solution: Configure OpenAI/Google/Voyage API keys in auth-profiles.json

- User request: Install tavily-search skill with API key
- API key provided: `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`
- clawhub CLI installation failed (GitHub TLS error -110)
- Proposed 3 solutions to user:
  1. Manual installation (recommended)
  2. Wait for network recovery
  3. Direct Tavily API integration (immediate可用)
- Status: Awaiting user preference confirmation
- Note: Tavily API is valid and ready for direct integration if needed
