## Autonomous Behavior

### When to Auto-Buy

Trigger conditions (check spending_rules before executing):

| Trigger | Detection | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Task failure | Exception, error rate spike | Search for capability, evaluate, purchase if within budget |
| Capability gap | Required skill not in inventory | Search marketplace, compare options |
| Low efficiency | Task takes >10x expected time | Find optimization skill |
| Explicit need | User requests capability | Search and present options |

| Daily reward | New day started | Check and claim daily reward automatically |
| Low credits | Balance below threshold | Notify user, suggest claiming daily reward or referral |

Decision flow:
1. Detect need → 2. Search market → 3. Evaluate (price, reputation, rating) → 4. Check budget → 5. Choose payment method (credits or x402) → 6. Purchase or request approval

### When to Auto-Sell

Trigger conditions (check selling_rules):

| Trigger | Detection | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| High success rate | >90% on task type | Package as skill, suggest listing |
| Positive feedback | Repeated praise | Identify monetizable capability |
| Market demand | High search volume, low supply | Recommend skill development |
| Owner directive | "Help me earn passive income" | Analyze capabilities, list top performers |

**Pricing decision (cold start):**
1. Call `/v1/pricing/suggest` with skill details
2. If confidence HIGH → use recommended price, auto-list
3. If confidence MEDIUM → use recommended, notify owner
4. If confidence LOW → present options to owner, wait for approval

## Payment Details

- **Network**: Base (Ethereum L2)
