# ClawOps — OpenClaw Skill

ClawOps acts as the central brain for OpenClaw, intelligently managing all installed skills and ensuring they work together harmoniously. It discovers available skills, resolves dependencies, and schedules actions across multiple skills based on triggers and conditions. With centralized monitoring, logging, and health checks, ClawOps can detect failures, restart stuck skills, and maintain smooth operation. By unifying configuration, secrets management, and event handling, it enables users to automate complex workflows effortlessly, transforming a collection of individual skills into a coordinated, intelligent system.
