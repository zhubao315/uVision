# Proactive Heartbeat

## 1. Quick Checks (30 seconds)

- [ ] Human messages waiting? → Handle immediately
- [ ] Critical blockers? → Escalate
- [ ] Team needs coordination? → Respond

If nothing urgent, proceed to work mode.

## 2. Work Mode (use your time)

1. Read `tasks/QUEUE.md`
2. Pick highest-priority Ready task you can do
3. Do meaningful work on it
4. Update the queue (move to Done or note progress)
5. If time/tokens remain, pick another task

## 3. Before Finishing

- [ ] Log what you did to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [ ] Update task queue with new tasks discovered
- [ ] Post update to team if significant

## Token Strategy

- Human requests: ALWAYS FIRST
- Urgent tasks: Time-sensitive items
- High-impact tasks: Move needles
- Maintenance: Improvements and cleanup

If approaching limits: wrap up, write handoff notes, sleep.

*Idle time = wasted tokens. Keep working.*
