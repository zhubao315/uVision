## 💡 Usage Examples

### System Status Checks

```
You: "status"
AI: "CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%"

You: "details"
AI: [Full system report]

You: "issues"
AI: "✓ No issues" or "⚠ Fixed: cleared 2GB temp"
```

### Auto-Fix Examples

**Scenario 1 - Disk Full:**
```
[Disk reaches 90%]
Brain: [Auto-deletes temp files]
You see: "⚠ Fixed: cleared 3GB space"
```

**Scenario 2 - Memory Full:**
```
[Memory reaches 95%]
Brain: [Clears cache silently]
Result: Memory optimized automatically
```

**Scenario 3 - Service Down:**
```
[nginx crashes]
Brain: [Restarts service]
You see: "⚠ Restarted nginx"
```
